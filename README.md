# 🗺️ USA States Guessing Game 🇺🇸

A fun and educational Python game where you try to guess all 50 states of the United States! The game is built using the `turtle` graphics module and basic Python concepts — perfect for beginners who want to explore interactive programming with visuals.

## 🎮 How It Works

- You’ll be prompted to enter the name of a U.S. state.
- If the state is correct and hasn't been guessed yet, it will be displayed on the map.
- The game continues until you've guessed all 50 states or you choose to exit.
- When you exit, a `.csv` file is generated with the states you missed so you can learn and try again!
